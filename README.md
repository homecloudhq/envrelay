# **EnvRelay**

**Stop Slacking Secrets. Start Securing Them.**

```bash
brew install envrelay
envrelay init
envrelay set API_KEY=sk_live_xxx
git commit -m "🔐"
```

* **Git-native.** Secrets live alongside your code, encrypted end-to-end.
* **Offline-first.** Works anywhere Git works — no central server required.
* **Team-ready.** Onboard a new device or teammate in seconds.
* **Scoped.** Keep prod secrets out of dev machines, automatically.

No dashboards. No YAML sprawl. No waiting on Ops.
Your `.env` files just… show up, decrypted, when you need them.

### Why It Exists

Most teams don’t realize their API keys are still sitting in chat logs from three years ago.
EnvRelay erases that risk by making secrets move like code — fast, safe, invisible.

> *One file. One key. Your rules.*
